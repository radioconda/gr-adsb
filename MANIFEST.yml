  A GNU Radio out-of-tree (OOT) module to demodulate and decode Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) messages.

  - Supports many SDRs through GNU Radio and OsmoSDR (USRP, RTL-SDR, HackRF, BladeRF, etc)
  - Supports various sample rates (2 Msps, 4 Msps, 6 Msps, etc). NOTE: Currently the sample rate must be an integer multiple of twice the symbol rate (2 Msym/s)
  - Decoding of messages:
    - DF 0: Short Air-Air Surveillance (ACAS)
    - DF 4: Surveillance Altitude Reply
    - DF 5: Surveillance Identity Reply
